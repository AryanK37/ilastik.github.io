1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:09,080
Open ilastik and choose the Carving workflow

2
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:20,060
Load your dataset (here a volume of mouse retina EM data, Winfried Denk, et al.)

3
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:30,000
Go to the Preprocessing applet and choose the right boundary type for your data

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,020
Toggle Filtered Data layer to check if the computed boundaries correspond to the edges in the image

5
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:48,060
Change the sigma of the smoothing kernel if the boundary map is too noisy or overly smooth

6
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,060
Click the Run button to apply preprocessing to your data

7
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:15,040
Go to the Labeling applet and mark the object of interest with an 'Object' seed and the outside with a 'Background' seed

8
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:23,000
Click Segment to start a seeded watershed segmentation

9
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:53,060
Scroll over your data and refine segmentation

10
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:16,020
Have a closer look at the 3D view of your object

11
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,520
Save the segmented object

12
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,020
See already segmented objects by enabling the Completed Segments overlay

13
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:42,000
Segment another object

14
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:20,020
Show both objects in 3D

15
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:39,020
Save the second object

16
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:46,020
Click Completed Segments to show segmented objects

17
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:57,080
Export mesh for 'object02'

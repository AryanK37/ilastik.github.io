title: "ilastik Fiji plugin version 2 released"
---

We are happy to announce the release of version 2.0 of our Fiji plugin.
The plugin allows you to conveniently import and export image in HDF5 format, as well as running trained Pixel Classification, Autocontext, Object Classification, Multicut, and Tracking Workflows from within Fiji.


HDF5 is a format that allows ilastik efficient block-wise processing of data.
You will get the best performance in ilastik using this format.

The plugin was almost completely rewritten by Emil Melnikov from our team.
In this new plugin version the reading speed for HDF5 files into Fiji has been improved 100x (!) compared to the previous version.
Writing is roughly 3x faster, too!
We took care to keep the plugin backwards compatible - all your macros should run as before.
In case we overlooked something, please let us know on [forum.image.sc](https://forum.image.sc/tag/ilastik)!

title: "Neural Network Classification Workflow (beta) released"
---

We are happy to announce an exciting new [beta release of ilastik](/download.html#beta).

This release contains the first public release of the Neural Network Classification workflow. [Usage/installation instructions](/documentation/nn/nn.html) will be updated in the coming days - but for those who can't wait, just download and try!!! As it stands, the workflow allows to apply pre-trained neural networks on your own data. Where do you find the networks? At the  [community model zoo](https://bioimage.io)! If there is no network for your problem yet, give it some time, or contribute one yourself!
